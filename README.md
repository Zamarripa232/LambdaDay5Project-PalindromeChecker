# Palindrome Checker
This is an android application that will check the input text to see if it can be read backwards the same was as forwards.

## Optional Challengey Bit
As part of the Lambda Precourse work there is an optional challenge bit.
That challenge is for the checker to ignore capitalization, punctuation and spaces when checking if a string is a palindrome.
